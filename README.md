# Client Side Analytics for Sitecore

This project adds a Web API for raising Sitecore Marketing events from client side javaScript including: goals, page events, outcomes and triggering campaigns.

It also exposes a method to return all the server side invoked events with basic data that can then be sent to a third party.

This was the basis for building a Segment Analytics.js plugin to send events to third parties.
